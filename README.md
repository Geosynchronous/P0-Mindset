# P0-Mindset
a Project from Udacity's FEND Web Development Nanodegree

This project replaces the old P0-About Me that was the first project I initially did.  It was a simple HTML page with info and graphics about me.  This new project is another .md file which is a letter to myself in the future.  The letter explains a lot more.
