# Establishing a Web Developer's Mindset

## A Letter to Myself
**Dear Geo,**
### Intro
I am writing a letter to myself for the future, about **Establishing a Web Developer's Mindset.**  Thing is, I started this **Udacity FEND Nanodegree Course** last fall, I am half way through the course, and am now backtracking to do this project of writing the letter.  This is Project Zero (P0), and it is not required for my graduation.  I am doing this,  to see what improvements have been made by Udacity and to see if I can gather any more gems of knowledge.  Originally when I did the first project for this course it was **P0: About Me**, which was a simple web page I created from a starter html file I edited.  The project was reviewed and passed.  Since then more projects have been added to this course, this letter project has replaced it, and at the moment I am just beginning to start on **P6: Website Optimization.**  I am writing this letter in MARKDOWN language, and I had the choice to also write it in HTML.  At this point I could write it in HMTL, but I have already learned, that for documentation purposes that MARKDOWN is much quicker and simpler to use.  I also have a [GITHUB REPOSITORY SPLASH PAGE](http://geosynchronous.github.io) that debues my ongoing work.
### Griping about the Excellent Nanodegree Program
I have really been enjoying the learning process so far in this course when it comes to coding the projects and having them reviewed by seasoned coders who always help me take things to the next step.  However, I have not been entirely satisfied with the course content and platform at all times.  Don't get me wrong some of it has been really good, but some of it has absolutely driven me nuts.  First the main web platform that the courses ran on was definitely clunky, and the lags times were really frustrating.  Well, I am happy to report there is a new platform, and runs much better now.  Also some of the course content, was ill conceived and/or poorly placed pedagogically.  Well now I am happy to report, that some of that has already been changed for the better, with the inclusion of new projects to ease the way into the complexity, revamped lessons, deletion of distracting content and so forth

I started with a Mentor and a Corhort group, but Udacity took it all away, and I miss it.  Even though it was a very good thing, everybody moves through these courses at different rates, so there is no way if really making that work.  On the otherhand, one of the great beauties of the nanodegrees is people have time to fit into their lives, which makes learning a lot more fun and practical.  Also I just hooked up with a coach who is allowing me to email him if REALLY needed.
### Suggested FEND Course Changes
One big distraction that still exists at the time of this writing is the placement of the GITHUB lessons.  It is a classical example of the timeless **Zippy the Pinhead** saying **"_TOO MUCH, TOO SOON, TOO FAST._"**  As a matter of fact, just yesterday I had my very first coaching session where I found out that basic GITHUB usage with the online repository along with a coinciding desktop app is just fine for getting through the course.  And that is what I have been doing, and plan to get better at the command line skills later in this course before I graduate.  My recommendation would be to remove the detailed Git and Github lessons, and offer them much later down the line, and instead replacing those lessons in the early phases of this course with just the rudiments to use the repository with the OS specific app.  The other thing is the early bombshell of having GRUNT task management dropped in your space too soon,  it really gets in the way of things.  Besides that, even though GRUNT is very useful, it is beginning to fade away, and GULP is picking up momentum because it is quicker to use.  To date, I have not really needed a task manager, though at some point I do plan on learning at least GULP in detail.  This kind of complex stuff should be placed later in the course when a student begins to get the hang of the whole FEND ecosystem.

**BTW:** The new web based platform is a great improvement when running on a laptop, but the on mobile devices it and the Udacity App have a lot to still be desired in terms of functionality. Though using the mobile devices to watch the videos is quite useful when you are multitasking over the stove top making delectable eats to fuel you for more hard work.

### Cool Idea for All Nanodegree Courses
Create a GITHUB REPOSITORY for each course where students can begin the contribution process early by posting any bugs they find or improvements they may think of that will help make UDACITY even more AWESOME!!!
### The Learning Journey in a Nutshell
So here is fantastic [GEM of KNOWLEDGE](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard) that i just ran across in the revamped course section for this project.  It really nails it on the head for newbies about the realistic learning processes to expect on this code learning journey to become a web developer.

The last six weeks of my Github Activity timeline shows a huge empty place of no activity.  That is because the need to attend to important domestic family issues needed my attention, and coincided with where I am on the bottom of the above graph in my learning journey.  I have just crept past the bottom of the confidence curve known as **THE DESERT OF DESPAIR. **  And I am now happy to report that I can feel the hairs on the back of neck tingle with the excitement and anticipation I feel moving into **THE UPSWING OF AWESOME.**
### My Bucket List of Goals
---
- Do the newly added Projects (P1 & P2)
- Continue finishing the remaining Projects (P6 - P8)
- Improve `Chrome Dev Tool` Skills
- Improve Github Skills
- Collaborate Contributions to Github Open Source Project
- Create my own Open Source Project
- Complete Github Repository Review
- Learn GULP
- Tweak out LinkedIN account to perfection
- Tweak out other Social Media accounts
- Use Forums Better
- Use Coaches Better
- Use SLACK more often
- Eat, Sleep and Move Better!!!
- Get a JOB!!! (With an Employer that values Employees)
- Or maybe launch a Start Up

### Conclusions
I really like this nanodegree course, and I may even take the Senior Web Developer and AI Courses.  But first things first, I need to finish this course and get a good job.  So see you on the other side of this course...


**Cheers,**
